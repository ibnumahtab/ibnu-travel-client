                        Serendipitously, after saving up every penny that we
                        had, we both set off on a life-changing solo backpacking
                        trip and met each other along the way. Since then, we
                        have traveled to countless countries and four continents
                        together. Not knowing what to expect (or how to even run
                        a travel blog), we started Adventure in You mainly
                        because we wanted to stay connected to something that we
                        loved which was traveling. Little did we know that
                        starting a travel blog together would end up changing
                        our lives as it has ultimately given us the freedom to
                        work and live from anywhere in the world.

                        Urban Travel Blog is a collective blog of expert travel
                        writers, headed up by experienced travel journalist and
                        editor Duncan Rhodes, who report on trends, experiences,
                        festivals and nocturnal adventures in cities around
                        Europe and the world. We publish lovingly-compiled ‘Long
                        Weekend’ city guides to all our favourite destinations,
                        as well as fresh and insightful feature articles on the
                        quirkiest crazes, the most intriguing experiences and
                        the best nightlife our boundless curiosity can uncover.
                        (Just hover you mouse over the “Adventures” tab on our
                        top menu to browse recent posts by category). And
                        because everyone needs to smell the flowers – and not
                        the coffee – once in a while, we like to offset our
                        urban Odysseys with the occasional jaunt in the great
                        outdoors in our Escape section.
